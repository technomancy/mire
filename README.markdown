# Mire

It's a nonviolent MUD. (Multi-User Dungeon)

You can either launch via SLIME by evaling mire.el from within Emacs
(preferred since it gives you access to the REPL) or by the included
mire.sh shell script.

Dependencies (clojure, clojure-contrib) are included, though you will
need a JVM on your system.

To connect, simply telnet to port 3333, or hit M-x mire from within
Emacs if you have used mire.el.
